Implementation of an anonymous and completely decentralized P2P file storage system, based on freenet (https://freenetproject.org/index.html) and other similar systems.

Components:
- Node, which is part of the system and communicates with other nodes.
- Client, which communicates with the local node. [ + client interface (optional)]

"stress.py" is used to spawn multiple nodes/uploaders in a single machine.
